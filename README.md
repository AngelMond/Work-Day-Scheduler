# Work-Day-Scheduler


# This project is an agenda that allows a user to save an event along the business hours. 

#   TECHNOLOGIES USED

* I created this proyect with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and some API's like moment.js to display the actual date on the web and jQuery.

# Challenges 

* I had a little troubles with the local storage in order to save the users event properly and that was a good challenge because now I can understand how the local storage works and how I can use it propperly.
